/* Basics */

/*Write a program that logs ‘Hello World’ to the screen.*/
//code here
/*Write a program that asks the user for their name and greets them with their name. (Use prompt)*/
//code here
/*Modify the previous program such that only the users Alice and Bob are greeted with their names.*/
//code here
/*Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints the sum of the numbers 1 to n*/
//code here
/*Modify the previous program such that only multiples of three or five are considered in the sum, e.g. 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15 for n=17*/
//code here
/*Write a program that asks the user for a number n and gives them the possibility to choose between computing the sum and computing the product of 1,…,n. (use prompt)*/
//code here
/*Write a program that prints a multiplication table for numbers up to 12. (1 * 1 = 1; 1*2 = 2 ... 1*2 = 2...)*/
//code here
/*Write a program that prints all prime numbers. (Note: if your programming language does not support arbitrary size numbers, printing all primes up to the largest number you can easily represent is fine too.)*/
//code here
/*Write a guessing game where the user has to guess a secret number. After every guess the program tells the user whether their number was too large or too small. At the end the number of tries needed should be printed. It counts only as one try if they input the same number multiple times consecutively.*/

/*Write a program that prints the next 20 leap years.*/

/* Arrays */

/*Write a function that returns the largest element in a array.*/
// code here
/*Write function that reverses a array, preferably in place.*/
// code here
/*Write a function that takes a number and returns a array of its digits. So for 2342 it should return [2,3,4,2].*/
// code here
/*Write a function that checks whether an element occurs in a array.*/
// code here
/*Write a function that returns the elements on odd positions in a array.*/
// code here
/*Write a function that computes the running total an array containing numbers.*/
// code here
/*Write a function on_all that applies a function to every element of a array. Use it to print the first twenty perfect squares. The perfect squares can be found by multiplying each natural number with itself. The first few perfect squares are 1*1= 1, 2*2=4, 3*3=9, 4*4=16. Twelve for example is not a perfect square because there is no natural number m so that m*m=12. (This question is tricky if your programming language makes it difficult to pass functions as arguments.)*/
// code here
/*Write a function that concatenates two arrays. [a,b,c], [1,2,3] → [a,b,c,1,2,3]*/
// code here
/*Write a function that combines two arrays by alternatingly taking elements. You may assume the arrays are always of equal length., e.g. [a,b,c], [1,2,3] → [a,1,b,2,c,3].*/
// code here
/*Write a function that rotates a array by k elements. For example [1,2,3,4,5,6] rotated by two becomes [3,4,5,6,1,2]. */
// code here
/*Write a function that computes the array of the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. The first two Fibonacci numbers are 1 and 1. The n+1-st Fibonacci number can be computed by adding the n-th and the n-1-th Fibonacci number. The first few are therefore 1, 1, 1+1=2, 1+2=3, 2+3=5, 3+5=8.*/
